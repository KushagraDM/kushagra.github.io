      <h2>Pop culture </h2> 
      <h3>by- Kushagra</h3>
      <p>What comes in your mind when you hear about..lets say...music? You think about your favourite singer,similarly with Film Stars, you think about your favourite one.
        Did you ever wonder why your parents do not bother into these western films and songs? Because these categories aims perticularly on youth in this modern era. These categories which are mainly aimed towards the young generation comes under Popular Culture aka 'Pop Culture'. Your parents do not bother in pop culture than you are because it is mainly aimed to be loved by you. It is the representation of the modern era by means of mass media.
                                                             Social media defines pop culture as what the latest trends are, what should people wear, how you should act publicly etc. It introduces and encourage the adoption of certain trends. We can see pop culture as 'tastemaker' (means or institution that shapes the way how the youth thinks, eat, listen, drink, dress and more).
        
         The most used medium of this culture are movies. What Genre films do you think is currently leading the global box office collections? Answer is 'Fantasy'. The once ubiquitous romance genre has been replaced at the top by fantasy and science fiction. Fantasy genre gives writers and filmmakers the creative freedom to explore ideas without the restrictions of writing stories set in the real world. So why is it this popular? Well this modern youth is obsessed with unrealistic or impossible situations. The more rational the world becomes the more they yearn for irrationality. Escapism from reality has been noted one of the main reasons why people are fascinalted with fantasy films. One of the main category of this genre is Superhero. The most popular player in this market is MARVEL STUDIOS which usually tops the all time global box office collections. This is because people feel more connected to the vision of the writers by this genre which can explore endless storylines without being restricted to the real world. 
        
        Therefore, Pop culture is a collective representation of the modern era via Music, Films, Social Media, Articles, Blogs, Memes etc to influence the youth in a postive or sometimes a negative and terrific way.
